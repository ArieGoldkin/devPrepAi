# HintSystem Component

## Overview
The HintSystem component provides a 4-level progressive hint system for assessment questions. It integrates with the Zustand store to track hint usage and apply score penalties.

## Features

- Smart timing - disables hints for first 2 minutes to encourage independent thinking
- Confirmation dialogs for higher-level hints (levels 3-4)
- Real-time score impact display
- Progressive disclosure - only shows next hint level
- Smooth animations and accessibility support

## Usage

import { HintSystem } from "@modules/assessment/components/hints";

  questionId={currentQuestion.id}
  className="mb-4"
