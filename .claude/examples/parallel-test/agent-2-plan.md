# Parallel Execution Plan - Agent 2

## Agent Identity
- Agent Type: backend-system-architect
- Work Stream: API and Backend Services
- Assigned Files: Backend APIs and services

## Tasks
1. **Wait for types** (BLOCKING)
   - Wait for: `/shared/types/metrics.ts`
   - Estimated wait: 10 minutes
   - Alternative task: Design database schema

2. **Design database schema**
   - Files: `/backend/models/metric.py`
   - Dependencies: None (can start immediately)
   - Output: SQLAlchemy models for metrics
   - Time: 15 minutes

3. **Implement REST API**
   - Files: `/backend/api/metrics.py`
   - Dependencies: Types defined, models created
   - Output: FastAPI endpoints for metrics
   - Time: 20 minutes

4. **Create analytics service**
   - Files: `/backend/services/analytics.py`
   - Dependencies: Models and API defined
   - Output: Business logic for analytics
   - Time: 15 minutes

5. **Build export utility**
   - Files: `/backend/utils/export.py`
   - Dependencies: Analytics service
   - Output: CSV/JSON export functionality
   - Time: 10 minutes

## File Ownership
### CREATE
- `/backend/models/metric.py`
- `/backend/api/metrics.py`
- `/backend/services/analytics.py`
- `/backend/utils/export.py`

### MODIFY
- None

### READ-ONLY
- `/shared/types/metrics.ts` (after agent-1 creates)
- `/shared/types/analytics.ts` (after agent-1 creates)
- `/config/analytics.config.js`

## Communication Points
- **Handoff to**: Integration phase
- **Receives from**: agent-1 (type definitions)
- **Sync points**:
  - Wait for types (10 min)
  - API ready notification (30 min)
  - Service complete (50 min)

## Execution Schedule
```
00:00 - 00:10: Design database schema (while waiting for types)
00:10 - 00:15: Read completed types from agent-1
00:15 - 00:35: Implement REST API endpoints
00:35 - 00:50: Create analytics service
00:50 - 01:00: Build export utility
```

## Lock Strategy
- No locks needed (exclusive ownership of `/backend/*`)
- Read-only access to `/shared/types/*` after creation
- May request lock on config files if updates needed

## Contingency Plans
- If types delayed: Continue with schema and mock interfaces
- If blocked on API: Work on export utility first
- If ahead of schedule: Add data validation and error handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Database models compile
- [ ] API endpoints respond to requests
- [ ] Service handles business logic
- [ ] Export generates valid CSV/JSON
- [ ] No conflicts with other agents
- [ ] Integration with frontend types
