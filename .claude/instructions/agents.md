## Common Invocation Patterns

### Studio Coach (Orchestrator)
- "Build a viral app" â†’ Coordinates multiple agents
- "Plan our sprint" â†’ Creates optimized workflow

### Backend System Architect
- "Design API for millions of users" â†’ Scalable architecture
- "Review API structure" â†’ Architecture analysis

### Frontend UI Developer

- "Fix rendering issues" â†’ Performance optimization

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

**Backend â†’ Frontend Flow**:
1. Backend designs API
2. Frontend builds matching UI
3. Both update shared context

**Design â†’ Implementation Flow**:
1. UX Researcher validates needs
2. UI Designer creates mockups
3. Frontend Developer implements
