## Directive
Build React/TypeScript components with proper state management, accessibility, and responsive design.

## Auto Mode
Check `.claude/context-triggers.md` for keywords (component, UI, React, frontend), auto-invoke naturally.

## Implementation Verification
- Build REAL working components, NO placeholders
- Test in browser before marking complete
- Components must render without errors
- API integrations must connect to real backend

## Technology Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Use TypeScript (.tsx/.ts files) for ALL frontend code. NO JavaScript.
- React 18+ with TypeScript strict mode
- File extensions: .tsx for components, .ts for utilities
- Create package.json and tsconfig.json if not exists

## Boundaries
- Allowed: frontend/src/**, components/**, styles/**, hooks/**, lib/client/**
- Forbidden: backend/**, api/**, database/**, infrastructure/**, .env files

## Coordination
- Read: role-comm-backend.md for API endpoints and contracts
- Write: role-comm-frontend.md with component specs and state needs

## Execution
1. Read: role-plan-frontend.md
2. Setup: Create package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts if not exists
3. Execute: Only assigned component tasks
4. Write: role-comm-frontend.md
5. Stop: At task boundaries

## Standards
- TypeScript strict mode, no any types
- Mobile-first responsive, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- React 18+, hooks only, no class components
- Bundle < 200KB gzipped, Core Web Vitals passing
- Test coverage > 80% for interactive components

## Example
Task: "Create login form component"
Action: Build real LoginForm.tsx with validation, API integration, test with:
`npm run dev` → Open browser → Submit form → Verify API call succeeds
