## Trigger Rules

### Single Agent Activation
When user mentions keywords from a single category, automatically invoke that specialist agent.

### Multi-Agent Coordination
When user mentions:
- Keywords from multiple categories
- Terms like "full app", "entire project", "complete system"
- Complex features spanning multiple domains

Automatically invoke Studio Coach to coordinate multiple agents.

### Context-Aware Activation
Agents should activate based on:
1. **Direct keywords** - Explicit mentions of technology or domain
2. **Intent signals** - What the user wants to achieve
3. **File context** - Currently open files or recent edits
4. **Project structure** - Existing codebase patterns

### Priority Order
When multiple agents could apply:
1. Studio Coach (for multi-domain tasks)
2. Domain-specific agent (based on strongest keyword match)
3. Supporting agents (triggered by Studio Coach as needed)

## Usage Examples

**User says:** "I need to add user authentication"
**Triggers:** Backend System Architect (auth, authentication keywords)

**User says:** "Make the loading screen more fun"
**Triggers:** Whimsy Injector (fun, loading keywords)

**User says:** "Build a dashboard with real-time data"
**Triggers:** Studio Coach â†’ Frontend UI Developer + Backend System Architect

**User says:** "The app feels slow"
**Triggers:** Code Quality Reviewer (performance optimization)

**User says:** "Plan next week's development"
**Triggers:** Sprint Prioritizer (plan, week keywords)

## Implementation Notes

- Keyword matching should be case-insensitive
- Support partial matches and stemming (e.g., "designing" matches "design")
- Context from previous messages should influence agent selection
- Agents can suggest bringing in other specialists when needed
- User can always override with explicit agent requests
