## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing

### Features We're Skipping (For Now)
- ❌ Dark mode - Use system default
- ❌ Animations - CSS transitions are enough
- ❌ Keyboard shortcuts - Most users won't use them
- ❌ Conversational Q&A - Regular Q&A works fine
- ❌ Adaptive difficulty - Let users choose
- ❌ Social features - Not MVP
- ❌ Email notifications - Not needed yet
- ❌ Real-time collaboration - Unnecessary complexity
- ❌ Advanced analytics - Basic stats are enough
- ❌ Micro-interactions - Pretty but not essential

### Why Skip These?
1. **Complexity**: Each adds 2-5 days of work
2. **Maintenance**: More code = more bugs
3. **Performance**: More features = slower app
4. **Focus**: Better to do core features well

---

## 📊 Time & Priority

### Must Have (8 tasks, ~10 hours)
- Tasks 1-6: Core functionality
- Task 11: Environment setup
- Task 14: CI/CD

### Should Have (5 tasks, ~8 hours)
- Tasks 7-8: Testing
- Task 10: Validation
- Task 13: Accessibility
- Task 15: Production prep

### Could Have (2 tasks, ~2 hours)
- Task 9: Performance
- Task 12: Logging

**Total: ~20 hours (2-3 days focused work)**

---

## ✅ Definition of Done

A task is DONE when:
1. It works
2. No errors in console
3. Follows existing design system
4. Doesn't break other features

That's it. No over-engineering.

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

The app is ready when:
- Users can complete a practice session without errors
- API costs are reasonable (<$0.01 per session)
- Loads in <3 seconds
- Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Deploys automatically

## 🚀 After MVP Ships

Once the essential version is live and working:
1. Gather user feedback
2. Fix bugs first
3. Only add features users actually request
4. Keep it simple

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of good.**

---

## 📝 Notes on Existing Design System

Use what we already have:
- **Colors**: #5b6cf8 (primary), #8b5cf6 (secondary), #0ea5e9 (accent)
- **Buttons**: Use existing variants (brand, accent, success, warning, error)
- **Cards**: Use existing variants (feature, interactive, gradient, elevated)
- **Spacing**: Stick to Tailwind defaults
- **Typography**: Use existing text classes

Don't create new components unless absolutely necessary.

*Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Ship it.*
