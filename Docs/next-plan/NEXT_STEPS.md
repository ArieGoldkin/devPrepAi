# DevPrep AI - Next Implementation Steps
## Single Source of Truth for Development Tasks

---

## 🎯 Overview

This is the **ONLY** document for next development steps. All tasks are prioritized and ready for implementation.

**Approach**: Start with critical MVP tasks, then enhance based on user feedback.

**Total Tasks**: 13 core tasks
**Timeline**: 5-7 days for MVP, additional 3-5 days for enhancements
**Focus**: Ship working product quickly, iterate based on feedback

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Days 1-2)
*These are non-negotiable for a working product*

### Task 1: React Query Setup ⚡
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Time**: 2 hours

**Why**: Reduce Claude API costs by 60% through intelligent caching.

**Implementation**:
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Create `/frontend/src/lib/query-client.ts`:
```typescript
export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,    // 10 minutes
      retry: 2,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    },
  },
});
```

Wrap app in `QueryClientProvider` and add DevTools.

**Success Metric**: API calls reduced, cost savings visible.

---

### Task 2: Questions State Management ⚡
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Time**: 2 hours

**Why**: Track user progress and session state properly.

**Implementation**:
Create `/frontend/src/store/slices/questionsSlice.ts` with:
- Current question index
- User answers array
- Hints revealed tracking
- Session completion status
- Performance metrics

Integrate with existing Zustand store and persist critical data to localStorage.

**Success Metric**: State persists across page refreshes.

---

### Task 3: Error Boundaries ⚡
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Time**: 1 hour

**Why**: Graceful error handling prevents app crashes.

**Implementation**:
1. Create `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component
2. Add fallback UI with retry button
3. Wrap critical sections (question display, AI evaluation, results)
4. Log errors to console (upgrade to service later)

**Success Metric**: Errors caught without crashing app.

---

### Task 4: Loading States ⚡
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Time**: 2 hours

**Why**: Users need feedback during API calls (2-3 seconds for Claude).

**Implementation**:
Create skeleton components:
- `QuestionSkeleton.tsx`
- `ResultSkeleton.tsx`
- `ProfileSkeleton.tsx`

Add shimmer animation and match exact dimensions of loaded content.

**Success Metric**: No blank screens during loading.

---

## 🎨 Phase 2: Core Features (Days 3-4)
*Essential features for good user experience*

### Task 5: Progressive Hint System
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Time**: 3 hours

**Why**: Hints help users learn without giving away answers.

**Implementation**:
1. Create `HintSystem.tsx` component with 4 progressive levels:
   - Level 1: Gentle nudge 💡
   - Level 2: Concept hint 🧠
   - Level 3: Approach hint 📝
   - Level 4: Pseudocode ✅
2. Track hint usage in questionsSlice
3. Add smooth reveal animations
4. Use brand colors for styling

**Success Metric**: Hints reveal progressively with smooth UX.

---

### Task 6: Answer Evaluation Loading
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Time**: 1 hour

**Why**: Evaluation takes 2-3 seconds, needs clear feedback.

**Implementation**:
- Add loading state to submit button
- Disable form during evaluation
- Show spinner with "Evaluating..." text
- Clear on complete/error

**Success Metric**: Clear feedback during evaluation process.

---

### Task 7: API Response Validation
**Priority**: 🟡 Important | **Time**: 1 hour

**Why**: Claude responses can vary in format.

**Implementation**:
1. Add zod schemas for API responses
2. Validate before using data
3. Fallback for invalid responses
4. Log validation errors

**Success Metric**: No crashes from unexpected API responses.

---

### Task 8: Basic Accessibility
**Priority**: 🟡 Important | **Time**: 2 hours

**Why**: Legal requirement and right thing to do.

**Implementation**:
- Add missing alt text
- Fix color contrast issues
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Add proper ARIA labels

**Success Metric**: Passes basic accessibility audit.

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Days 5-6)
*Nice-to-have features that improve the experience*

### Task 9: Toast Notifications
**Priority**: 🟡 Important | **Time**: 1 hour

**Why**: Better user feedback for actions.

**Implementation**:
```bash
npm install sonner
```
Add toasts for: answer submitted, session saved, errors occurred.

**Success Metric**: Clear feedback for all user actions.

---

### Task 10: Empty States
**Priority**: 🟡 Important | **Time**: 1 hour

**Why**: Guide users when there's no data.

**Implementation**:
Create `EmptyState.tsx` component for:
- No questions generated
- No results yet
- No profile created

Include helpful messages and action buttons.

**Success Metric**: No confusing blank screens.

---

### Task 11: Bundle Size Optimization
**Priority**: 🟡 Important | **Time**: 2 hours

**Why**: Faster initial load improves user experience.

**Implementation**:
1. Run bundle analyzer
2. Remove unused dependencies
3. Implement code splitting
4. Lazy load heavy components
5. Target: <200KB initial bundle

**Success Metric**: Initial load under 3 seconds.

---

### Task 12: Environment Configuration
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical | **Time**: 1 hour

**Why**: Separate dev/production configurations.

**Implementation**:
1. Create `.env.production`
2. Move API keys to env vars
3. Add validation on startup
4. Document required variables

**Success Metric**: Configurations properly separated.

---

### Task 13: Basic Unit Tests
**Priority**: 🟡 Important | **Time**: 3 hours

**Why**: Prevent regressions in critical paths.

**Implementation**:
Test only critical functions:
- Store actions
- Question navigation
- API error handling
- Form validation

**Success Metric**: Core functionality protected by tests.

---

## ⏰ Timeline & Priorities

### Must Have (MVP)
**Days 1-2**: Tasks 1-4
- React Query setup
- State management
- Error boundaries
- Loading states

### Should Have (Core Features)
**Days 3-4**: Tasks 5-8
- Hint system
- Evaluation feedback
- API validation
- Accessibility

### Could Have (Polish)
**Days 5-6**: Tasks 9-13
- Toast notifications
- Empty states
- Performance optimization

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

The implementation is successful when:
- ✅ Users can complete a full practice session
- ✅ API costs < $0.01 per session
- ✅ No crashes or data loss
- ✅ Loads in < 3 seconds
- ✅ Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- ✅ Accessibility audit passes

---

## 🚫 What We're NOT Doing (Yet)

These can wait for post-launch:
- ❌ E2E testing (add after MVP ships)
- ❌ CI/CD deployment (manual deploy is fine initially)
- ❌ Dark mode (use system default)
- ❌ Advanced animations (CSS transitions are enough)
- ❌ Conversational Q&A (regular Q&A works)
- ❌ Adaptive difficulty (let users choose)
- ❌ Social features (not MVP)

---

## 💡 Implementation Tips

1. **Start with Tasks 1-4** - They're the foundation everything else builds on
2. **Use existing design system** - Don't create new components unless necessary
3. **Keep it simple** - We can always add complexity later
4. **Test manually first** - Automated tests can come after shipping
5. **Deploy early** - Get feedback on core features before adding nice-to-haves

---

## 📝 Next Actions

1. **Today**: Complete Tasks 1-2 (React Query + State)
2. **Tomorrow**: Complete Tasks 3-4 (Error Handling + Loading)
3. **Day 3**: Complete Tasks 5-6 (Hints + Evaluation)
4. **Day 4**: Complete Tasks 7-8 (Validation + Accessibility)
5. **Day 5**: Complete remaining tasks based on priority

*Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship it, get feedback, iterate.*
