# Next Phase Documentation

## 📍 Single Source of Truth

### ➡️ NEXT_STEPS.md
**The ONLY task document you need.**

This consolidated document contains all implementation tasks, properly prioritized and organized into clear phases:

- **Phase 1**: MVP Foundation (Days 1-2) - Critical tasks only
- **Phase 2**: Core Features (Days 3-4) - Essential UX improvements
- **Phase 3**: Polish & Enhancement (Days 5-6) - Nice-to-haves

**Total**: 13 focused tasks | **Timeline**: 5-7 days | **Approach**: Ship fast, iterate based on feedback

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **One Document**: No more confusion between multiple task lists
2. **Clear Priorities**: Each task marked as Critical, Important, or Nice-to-have
3. **Phased Approach**: MVP first, enhancements later
4. **No Premature Optimization**: Testing and deployment come after shipping
5. **User Feedback Driven**: Ship core features, let users guide what's next
