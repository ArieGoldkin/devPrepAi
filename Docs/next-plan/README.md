# Next Plan Documentation

## ðŸ“‹ Available Task Documents

### ESSENTIAL_TASKS.md (Recommended)
**15 tasks | 2-3 days | Just the essentials**

Start here. This is the pragmatic, no-nonsense approach to getting DevPrep AI production-ready. Focuses only on what's necessary:
- React Query for API caching
- Basic error handling
- Loading states
- Minimal testing
- Production config

**Use this if**: You want to ship quickly and iterate based on real user feedback.

---

### IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md (Comprehensive)
**35 tasks | 15-20 days | Everything including nice-to-haves**

The complete wishlist. Includes advanced features like:
- Conversational Q&A flow
- Adaptive difficulty algorithms
- Dark mode
- Micro-interactions
- Extensive testing
- Performance optimizations

**Use this if**: You have time and resources for a fully-featured product.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**Start with ESSENTIAL_TASKS.md**

Why?
1. Ship faster (2-3 days vs 15-20 days)
2. Get real user feedback sooner
3. Less complexity = fewer bugs
4. Easier to maintain
5. Can always add features later

The ESSENTIAL tasks will give you a working product that:
- âœ… Handles errors gracefully
- âœ… Provides good user feedback
- âœ… Caches API responses (saves money)
- âœ… Works reliably
- âœ… Deploys automatically

Everything else can wait until users actually ask for it.
