# Notion Database Import Instructions

## üìã Overview

I've created a comprehensive CSV file with all 150 tasks ready to import into your Notion database.

**Database**: [üé® Design System Implementation](https://www.notion.so/28a4489affb9812d9ae1e0c23903c44c)
**CSV File**: `notion-tasks-import.csv`

---

## üöÄ How to Import

### Method 1: Notion Web Import (Recommended)

1. **Open your Notion database**:
   - Go to: https://www.notion.so/28a4489affb9812d9ae1e0c23903c44c

2. **Click the ‚ãÆ menu** (top right of the database)

3. **Select "Merge with CSV"**

4. **Upload the CSV file**:
   - Navigate to: `/Docs/design-system/notion-tasks-import.csv`
   - Select the file

5. **Map the columns**:
   - Notion will auto-detect most columns
   - Verify mappings:
     - Task ID ‚Üí Task ID
     - Task Name ‚Üí Task Name
     - Phase ‚Üí Phase
     - Status ‚Üí Status
     - Priority ‚Üí Priority
     - Estimate (hrs) ‚Üí Estimate (hrs)
     - Notes ‚Üí Notes

6. **Click "Import"**

7. **Verify**: You should now see all 150 tasks in your database

### Method 2: Manual Copy-Paste (Alternative)

If CSV import doesn't work:

1. Open the CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Select all rows
3. Copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)
4. In Notion database, click in first empty row
5. Paste (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)
6. Notion will create rows automatically

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After import, verify:

- [ ] Total of 150 tasks visible
- [ ] Phase 1 has 13 tasks (DS-001 to DS-013)
- [ ] Phase 2 has 15 tasks (DS-014 to DS-028)
- [ ] Phase 3 has 18 tasks (DS-029 to DS-046)
- [ ] Phase 4 has 12 tasks (DS-047 to DS-058)
- [ ] Phase 5 has 42 tasks (DS-059 to DS-100)
- [ ] Phase 6 has 11 tasks (DS-101 to DS-111)
- [ ] Phase 7 has 14 tasks (DS-112 to DS-125)
- [ ] Phase 8 has 16 tasks (DS-126 to DS-141)
- [ ] Phase 9 has 9 tasks (DS-142 to DS-150)
- [ ] All P0 tasks have Priority = "P0"
- [ ] All estimates are in hours (0.1 to 1.0)
- [ ] All tasks have Status = "Not Started"

## üìä Task Distribution

| Phase | Tasks | Hours | Priority Breakdown |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|
| Phase 1 | 13 | 3-4 | P0: 10, P1: 1, P2: 2 |
| Phase 2 | 15 | 4-5 | P0: 13, P1: 1, P2: 1 |
| Phase 3 | 18 | 5-6 | P0: 11, P1: 7, P2: 0 |
| Phase 4 | 12 | 4-5 | P0: 8, P1: 2, P2: 2 |
| Phase 5 | 42 | 8-10 | P0: 28, P1: 14, P2: 0 |
| Phase 6 | 11 | 3-4 | P0: 9, P1: 2, P2: 0 |
| Phase 7 | 14 | 4-5 | P0: 0, P1: 12, P2: 2 |
| Phase 8 | 16 | 3-4 | P0: 2, P1: 8, P2: 6 |
| Phase 9 | 9 | 2-3 | P0: 1, P1: 6, P2: 2 |

## üéØ Using the Database

### Filter by Phase
Create a view grouped by "Phase" to see tasks organized by implementation phase.

### Filter by Priority
Create a view filtered by Priority = "P0" to see critical tasks first.

### Track Progress
Update Status field as you complete tasks:
- üîµ Not Started ‚Üí üü° In Progress ‚Üí üü¢ Completed

### Dependencies
Some tasks depend on others. For example:
- DS-002 depends on DS-001 (need pnpm installed first)
- DS-008 depends on DS-007 (need packages/ dir first)
- All Phase 5 tasks depend on Phase 4 completion (need Storybook setup)

### Time Tracking
Use the "Estimate (hrs)" field to plan sprints and track velocity.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### CSV import fails
- **Issue**: Notion shows "Import failed"
- **Solution**: Open CSV in a text editor and ensure no special characters in Notes field

### Duplicate tasks created
- **Issue**: Import ran twice
- **Solution**: Select all duplicate tasks and delete them

### Column mapping incorrect
- **Issue**: Data appears in wrong columns
- **Solution**: During import, manually map each CSV column to the correct Notion property

### Missing select options
- **Issue**: Phase or Status values not recognized
- **Solution**: Notion will auto-create select options during import. Verify they match:
  - Phase: "Phase 1" through "Phase 9"
  - Status: "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed", "Blocked"
  - Priority: "P0", "P1", "P2"

## ‚ú® Next Steps

After importing all 150 tasks:

1. **Review the database** - Familiarize yourself with all tasks
2. **Read the documentation** - Start with `README.md`
3. **Plan your sprint** - Decide which phase to start with
4. **Begin Phase 1** - Follow `02-monorepo-setup.md`
5. **Track progress** - Update task statuses as you work
