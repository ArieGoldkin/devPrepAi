## 📝 Question Types & Variations

### Current Question Types Generated
Based on our testing, the AI generates various types of technical interview questions:

#### 1. **Coding Challenges**
- Example: "Implement a Debounced Search Component"
- Characteristics:
  - Requires writing actual code
  - Usually involves React/TypeScript components
  - Tests practical implementation skills
  - Includes specific requirements (e.g., 300ms debounce, error handling)

#### 2. **System Design Questions**
- Topics: Architecture patterns, scalability, data flow
- Format: Explanatory answers with diagrams

#### 3. **Behavioral Questions**
- Topics: Team collaboration, problem-solving approaches
- Format: STAR method responses

#### 4. **Conceptual Questions**
- Topics: JavaScript fundamentals, React hooks, TypeScript
- Format: Explanations with examples

## 🎯 Priority Enhancements

### 1. Code Editor for Coding Questions ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Current Issue**: Coding questions use a plain text input field
**Solution**: Implement a proper code editor component

#### Requirements:
- Syntax highlighting for JavaScript/TypeScript/React
- Line numbers
- Auto-indentation
- Basic code formatting (Prettier integration)
- Theme support (light/dark)
- Language detection based on question type
- Monospace font
- Tab support for indentation

#### Suggested Libraries:
1. **@monaco-editor/react** (VS Code editor)
   - Pros: Full IDE features, excellent TypeScript support
   - Cons: Larger bundle size (~2MB)

2. **react-simple-code-editor** with Prism.js
   - Pros: Lightweight (~50KB), simple integration
   - Cons: Basic features only

3. **CodeMirror 6**
   - Pros: Highly customizable, good performance
   - Cons: More complex setup

#### Implementation Plan:
```tsx
// components/CodeEditor.tsx
interface ICodeEditorProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  language: 'javascript' | 'typescript' | 'jsx' | 'tsx';
  placeholder?: string;
  readOnly?: boolean;
  minHeight?: string;
  maxHeight?: string;
}
```

## 🔄 Dynamic Question Handling

### Question Type Detection
Implement automatic detection of question type based on content:

```typescript
enum QuestionType {
  CODING = 'coding',
  SYSTEM_DESIGN = 'system_design',
  BEHAVIORAL = 'behavioral',
  CONCEPTUAL = 'conceptual'
}

function detectQuestionType(question: IQuestion): QuestionType {
  const content = question.content.toLowerCase();

  if (content.includes('implement') ||
      content.includes('write a function') ||
      content.includes('create a component')) {
    return QuestionType.CODING;
  }

  if (content.includes('design') ||
      content.includes('architect') ||
      content.includes('scale')) {
    return QuestionType.SYSTEM_DESIGN;
  }

  // ... additional logic
}
```

### Dynamic Input Component
Based on question type, render appropriate input:

```tsx
function getAnswerInputComponent(questionType: QuestionType) {
  switch(questionType) {
    case QuestionType.CODING:
      return CodeEditor;
    case QuestionType.SYSTEM_DESIGN:
      return DiagramEditor;
    default:
      return TextEditor;
  }
}
```
