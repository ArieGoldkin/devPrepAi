## üìù Question Types & Variations

### Current Question Types Supported
The AI generates various types of technical interview questions:

#### 1. **Coding Challenges**
- Example: "Implement a Debounced Search Component"
- Characteristics:
  - Requires writing actual code
  - Usually involves React/TypeScript components
  - Tests practical implementation skills
  - Includes specific requirements (e.g., 300ms debounce, error handling)

#### 2. **System Design Questions**
- Topics: Architecture patterns, scalability, data flow
- Format: Explanatory answers with diagrams

#### 3. **Behavioral Questions**
- Topics: Team collaboration, problem-solving approaches
- Format: STAR method responses

#### 4. **Conceptual Questions**
- Topics: JavaScript fundamentals, React hooks, TypeScript
- Format: Explanations with examples

## üéØ Phase 2: Planned Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Code Editor Features ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: Basic editor complete, advanced features planned
**Goal**: Enhanced coding experience

#### Planned Features:
- [ ] Auto-completion (IntelliSense-like)
- [ ] Code formatting on demand (Prettier integration)
- [ ] Multiple file tabs for complex problems
- [ ] Split view (problem description / solution)
- [ ] Test runner integration
- [ ] Console output display
- [ ] Code execution sandbox

#### Potential Libraries:
- Monaco Editor for full IDE experience
- Judge0 API for code execution
- WebContainers for in-browser Node.js

### 2. Immediate Answer Evaluation (In Progress)
**Status**: Design phase (see `/Docs/question-answering-enhancement/`)
**Goal**: Real-time feedback during practice

#### Planned Flow:
```
User types answer ‚Üí Click "Submit" ‚Üí Immediate AI evaluation
‚Üí Feedback modal ‚Üí Choose: "Revise Answer" OR "Next Question"
‚Üí Up to 2 revisions per question
```

**Benefits**:
- Immediate learning feedback
- Iterative improvement opportunity
- Better engagement and retention
- Simulates real interview dynamics

**Implementation**: Phase 1, 2, 3 docs available in `/Docs/question-answering-enhancement/`

### 3. Dynamic Question Type Detection
**Status**: Planned
**Goal**: Automatic UI adaptation based on question type

```typescript
enum QuestionType {
  CODING = 'coding',
  SYSTEM_DESIGN = 'system_design',
  BEHAVIORAL = 'behavioral',
  CONCEPTUAL = 'conceptual'
}

// Auto-detect and render appropriate input
function getAnswerInputComponent(questionType: QuestionType) {
  switch(questionType) {
    case QuestionType.CODING:
      return CodeEditor;
    case QuestionType.SYSTEM_DESIGN:
      return DiagramEditor; // Future: Excalidraw integration
    default:
      return RichTextEditor;
  }
}
```
