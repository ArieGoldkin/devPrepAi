## 📝 Development Notes

### Current Focus
- Setting up the frontend foundation with strict code quality rules
- Ensuring all configurations align with our code standards
- Creating a modular, maintainable architecture from the start

### Important Reminders
1. **Every file must be < 180 lines** - Split large files immediately
2. **Complexity score must be < 15** - Refactor complex functions
3. **Use Anthropic API, not OpenAI** - All AI features use Claude
4. **Mobile-first design** - Test on mobile viewport regularly
5. **No authentication in MVP** - Use localStorage for user data

### Dependencies to Watch
- Anthropic SDK updates
- Next.js 15 features
- shadcn/ui components
- React 19 patterns
